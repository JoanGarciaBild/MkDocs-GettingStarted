It's based on Eclipse but comes pre-configured with tools and plugins for easier Spring Boot development. Step 1: Download Eclipse STS Visit the official Spring website to download the installer: \ud83c\udf10 STS Downloads: https://spring.io/tools Choose the version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux). \u26a0\ufe0f Make sure you have a JDK (Java Development Kit) installed and configured before running Eclipse STS. Preferably Java 17 or 21. Step 2: Extract and Launch STS Once downloaded, unzip the file to a convenient location, for example: Open the folder and launch: SpringToolSuite4.exe (Windows) SpringToolSuite4.app (macOS) SpringToolSuite4 executable (Linux) Step 3: Configure JDK (If needed) If STS doesn't detect your JDK: Go to Window > Preferences > Java > Installed JREs . Click Add > Standard VM . Locate your JDK folder (e.g., C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk-21 ) and click Finish . Select it as the default and click Apply and Close . Step 4: Create a New Spring Boot Project Click on File > New > Spring Starter Project . Enter the project name and base package (e.g., com.example.demo ). Choose: Java version (17 or 21). Project type: Maven (recommended). Dependencies: Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, PostgreSQL, etc. Click Finish . STS will generate a complete Spring Boot project ready to run and develop. Step 5: Run Your Project Once the project is created: Locate the main class (annotated with @SpringBootApplication ). Right-click on it and select Run As > Spring Boot App . \u2705 If everything is configured correctly, the embedded server (like Tomcat) will start, and your app will run locally. Optional Tips \ud83d\udca1 Install Lombok Plugin : Go to Help > Eclipse Marketplace , search for Lombok , and install it. \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Dark Theme : Preferences > General > Appearance > Theme > Choose \"Dark\". \ud83d\udce6 Install More Plugins : Use the Eclipse Marketplace to add support for Git, Docker, etc.","title":"Eclipse / STS"},{"location":"eclipse/#installing-eclipse-sts-spring-tool-suite","text":"Eclipse STS (Spring Tool Suite) is an IDE tailored for Spring developers.
